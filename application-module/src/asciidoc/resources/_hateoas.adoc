_{project-name}_ uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their responses.

Responses are in https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification[Hypertext
Application Language (HAL)] format.

Links can be found beneath the `_links` key.
Users of the API should not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate from resource to resource.

With providing any `Link` or not is it possible to drive the state of the application.

NOTE: Each Resource Object SHOULD contain a _self_ link that corresponds with the IANA registered 'self' relation (as defined by [RFC5988]) whose target is the resource's URI.
